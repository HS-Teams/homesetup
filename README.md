Are you passionate about the terminal and CLI? If so, you've come to the right place, especially if you're a command
line enthusiast. Terminal dotfiles are well-known for improving productivity and streamlining everyday tasks. While
there are numerous frameworks available to assist with this, many of them come with a steep learning curve and are
primarily targeted towards individuals with strong programming skills. Additionally, these frameworks often employ
esoteric syntax, requiring an additional effort to fully utilize their features.

Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could effortlessly upload and download our configurations, dotfiles, packages, and
customizations to the cloud? This is where HomeSetup comes in. It provides a solution that simplifies the process,
allowing you to leverage the power of the cloud seamlessly.

With **HomeSetup**, you can enhance your terminal experience, boost productivity, and customize your shell to suit your
preferences all without the complexities often associated with other frameworks. HomeSetup was specifically developed
to enhance the command line experience for users. Its primary objective is to provide useful and user-friendly features
that expedite daily tasks, such as time tracking, string and file searching, directory navigation, and seamless
integration with popular tools like Git, Gradle, Docker, and more.

> **THIS IT NOT JUST A DOTFILES FRAMEWORK**

## Catalina moved from bash to zsh

Starting with the _Catalina_ version of macOS, the default shell has been switched to **Zsh**. Nonetheless, you retain
the flexibility to change the default shell back to bash. To accomplish this, you can utilize the following command:

```bash
sudo chsh -s /bin/bash
```

If Apple decides to remove **Bash** from future macOS releases, you can always rely on Homebrew's version. In such cases,
the path to the shell may differ. Here's an alternative approach:

```bash
brew install bash
sudo chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash
```

## Installation

### Operating Systems

- Darwin (macOS)
  - High Sierra and higher
- Linux
  - Ubuntu 16 and higher
  - CentOS  7 and higher
  - Fedora 31 and higher
  - Alpine (jenkins-agent)

> While it's possible to install HomeSetup on **other Linux** distributions and it might work, it's important to note
> that **there are no guarantees** of its _full functionality or compatibility_.

### Supported Shells

- Bash: Everything from 3.2.57(1) and higher.
- Zsh: Zsh is planned but not supported yet.

### Terminal configuration

To visualize the Font-Awesome unicode icons, you'll need a compatible nerd font. We recommend using the font we provide with the installation:

  [Droid font](assets/fonts/Droid-Sans-Mono-for-Powerline-Nerd-Font-Complete.otf).

**Linux users**: Some terminals already support icons, but if not, you can manually install the font.

**Mac users**: We suggest using one of the terminal profiles listed below to ensure optimal icon display.

You can execute the following commands to install it even before installing HomeSetup:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/yorevs/homesetup/releases/download/v1.7.17/Droid-Sans-Mono-for-Powerline-Nerd-Font-Complete.zip -o /tmp/Droid-Sans-Mono.zip && unzip -o /tmp/Droid-Sans-Mono.zip -d $HOME/.fonts/DroidSan-MonoforPowerlineNerdFontComplete && fc-cache -f
```

**Mac users**: There is one additional step:

```bash
cp -f $HOME/.fonts/DroidSan-MonoforPowerlineNerdFontComplete/*.otf $HOME/Library/Fonts  && fc-cache -f
```

#### Terminal App (Darwin)

  [HomeSetup Terminal](assets/terminal/HomeSetup.terminal)

#### iTerm2 App (Darwin)

  [HomeSetup iTerm2](assets/iTerm2-HomeSetup.json)

When your terminal is set, then you should see something like this:

### Try-it first

<img src="https://iili.io/dydwcjR.gif">

Running HomeSetup in a Docker container offers a convenient and isolated environment for testing purposes, ensuring
that your machine remains unaffected during the evaluation process. Use one of the following docker images:

#### amd64

```bash
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-centos:amd64-latest
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-ubuntu:amd64-latest
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-fedora:amd64-latest
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-alpine:amd64-latest
```

#### arm64

```bash
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-centos:arm64-latest
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-ubuntu:arm64-latest
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-fedora:arm64-latest
```

> Alpine is not available for **arm64** architecture.

### Remote installation

This is the recommended installation method. You can install HomeSetup directly from GitHub by executing one of the
following commands:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yorevs/homesetup/master/install.bash | bash
```

or

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yorevs/homesetup/master/install.bash | bash
```

### Local installation

Clone the HomeSetup repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yorevs/homesetup.git ~/HomeSetup
```

And then install all dotfiles using the following command:

**To install all files at once**
```bash
cd ~/HomeSetup && ./install.bash
```

or

**To install one by one**
```bash
cd ~/HomeSetup && ./install.bash -i
```

Your existing dotfiles (such as .bashrc, .bash_profile, etc.) will be backed up with the **'.orig'** suffix and stored
in the **~/.hhs/backup** folder. This ensures that your original dotfiles are safely preserved during the installation
process.

Once the installation is completed successfully, you should see the following welcome message:

[HomeSetup Welcome](https://iili.io/JuxFH3G.png "Welcome to HomeSetup")

### Firebase setup

HomeSetup provides the capability to utilize your Firebase account for uploading and downloading your custom files
(dotfiles file synchronization) to your *Real-time Database*. To utilize this feature, you must first configure your
Google Firebase account. Please check the [Firebase Setup](docs/FIREBASE_SETUP.md) document for instructions.

configurations please checkout the [Starship](https://starship.rs/) website. Please check the [Starship Plugin](docs/handbook/pages/applications/bash/hhs-app/plugins/starship.md)
document for mode details about HomeSetup / Starship integration.

### ColorLS Integration

HomeSetup, now, integrates the new modern **ls** command [ColorLS](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls). HomeSetup
will not install it, but once you have installed it, it will be used instead of the built-in **ls**.

Please check the [ColorLS Setup](docs/COLOR_LS_SETUP.md) document for more instructions on how to set up ColorLS.

### FZF Integration

HomeSetup, now, integrates the modern [fuzzy-finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). HomeSetup
will not install it, but once you have installed it, it will be used. We have set the common configurations like the
key bindings (Ctrl+T \[find\] and Ctrl+R \[history\]) and auto-completions. Is also integrates with
[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) (extended 'cat') and [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) (extended 'find').

Please check the [FZF Docs](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#examples) for more usage examples.

### AskAI Integration

HomeSetup now integrates with the AskAI application. You can ask questions about the terminal or any aspect of the HomeSetup project. You can also request assistance in building commands and using HomeSetup easily. You just need to ask!

It's required that you own accounts on GoogleSearch API (for searching the web), DeepL (for translations), and OpenAI. For that is required that you provide the following Api Keys:

1. GOOGLE_API_KEY
2. OPENAI_API_KEY
3. DEEPL_API_KEY

For more information about getting the ApiKeys, please check: [AskAI](https://github.com/yorevs/askai).

## Uninstallation

If you choose to uninstall HomeSetup and restore your old dotfiles, you can do so by issuing the following command
in a shell:

`# HomeSetup $ ./uninstall.bash`

The uninstaller will remove all files and folders associated with HomeSetup. The only folder that will remain is
the **$HHS_DIR** (~/.hhs typically), whereas your configurations were stored. After a successful uninstallation, it is
safe to delete this folder if you no longer need it, **HOWEVER ALL CUSTOM DOTFILES WILL BE GONE**.

## Final notes

HomeSetup is designed to automatically fetch updates **every 7 days** from the time of installation. However, if you
want to manually ensure that your HomeSetup is up to date, you can run one of the following command in your terminal:

`hhs updater execute update`

or just

`hhu`

This will install the latest version of HomeSetup, keeping your setup current and incorporating any new features and
improvements. Keeping HomeSetup updated is essential to benefit from the latest enhancements and bug fixes. If you have
any questions or encounter any issues during the update process, feel free to reach out for assistance.
