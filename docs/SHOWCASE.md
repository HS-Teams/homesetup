> The ultimate Terminal experience

## How can I try it ?

There are two ways of trying HomeSetup:

### Local installation

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yorevs/homesetup/master/install.bash | bash
```

or

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yorevs/homesetup/master/install.bash | bash
```

### Run on Docker

If you're uncertain about the changes that the installation may bring or prefer to try it out in a controlled
environment, you can opt for the **Docker method**. By using it, you can run HomeSetup within a container without
affecting your host system. This allows you to experiment and evaluate the installation before making any permanent
changes. You can try HomeSetup on Docker, issuing one of the following commands:

#### amd64

```bash
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-centos:amd64-latest
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-ubuntu:amd64-latest
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-fedora:amd64-latest
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-alpine:amd64-latest
```

#### arm64

```bash
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-centos:arm64-latest
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-ubuntu:arm64-latest
docker run --rm -it yorevs/hhs-fedora:arm64-latest
```

> Alpine is not available for **arm64** architecture.

## Creating your custom dotfiles

HomeSetup provides a structured organization for dotfiles, categorizing them into seven distinct categories:

1. **Aliases** (`~/.aliases`): This file contains custom aliases that can be created or overridden to suit your needs.
2. **Environment Variables** (`~/.env`): Here, you can define environment variables specific to your setup.
3. **Paths** (`~/.path`): The `~/.path` file allows you to customize the system paths used by your shell.
4. **Prompt** (`~/.prompt`): Customize your shell prompt by editing the `~/.prompt` file.
5. **Colors** (`~/.colors`): This file lets you define custom color schemes for your terminal.
6. **Functions** (`~/.functions`): Define your own custom functions in the `~/.functions` file.
7. **Personal Profile** (`~/.profile`): The `~/.profile` file serves as your personal profile, where you can include additional configurations or source your custom dotfiles.

Within HomeSetup, there are specific manager applications for some of the custom dotfiles:

1. `__hhs_envs`: Manages the custom environment variables defined in `~/.env`.
2. `__hhs_paths`: Handles the custom paths defined in `~/.path`.
3. `__hhs_aliases`: Manages the custom aliases defined in `~/.aliases`.

To make your experience more convenient, it utilizes a set of aliases that provide shortcuts to most of the `__hhs`
functions. These aliases are defined in the `.aliasdef` file located in the **$HHS_DIR** folder. While you have the
flexibility to manually edit this file, for the sake of this demonstration, the default definitions will be used.

You can watch a demo of some of HomeSetup's features in the asciicast below:

[![HomeSetup-Aliases](https://asciinema.org/a/583777.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/583777)

Please note that custom dotfiles are partially supported by HomeSetup. While you can create them, you will need to
source them manually. It is recommended to include your custom dotfiles in the `.profile` file for easy sourcing and
integration with HomeSetup. Feel free to explore and modify the custom dotfiles according to your preferences,
leveraging the power and flexibility of HomeSetup to create a tailored and efficient terminal environment.

## Saving your dotfiles on the cloud

HomeSetup offers seamless integration with [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/), allowing you to
securely save and load all of your dotfiles. This feature ensures that your setup is backed up using Google's powerful
realtime database capabilities.

## Integrations

### Firebase

# Shell is boring, I prefer a graphical interface

Indeed, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) can be helpful when getting started with a new application. However, they
often hide the advanced features and functionalities of the underlying tool. What if you could have the convenience of
a visual interface, similar to a command line, without the need to install numerous packages?

With HomeSetup, you can experience a user-friendly interface that harnesses the power of the command line. It provides
a streamlined and efficient way to access and utilize advanced features, all within a familiar terminal environment.
HomeSetup eliminates the need for excessive package installations, allowing you to focus on maximizing the capabilities
of the underlying tools.

By leveraging the command line interface of HomeSetup, you can explore the full potential of the application while
maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of a visual interface. Enjoy the best of both worlds with HomeSetup's
intuitive and feature-rich command line experience.

# Small learning curve

All the information you need to understand and utilize HomeSetup can be found in the comprehensive [User Handbook](handbook/handbook.md).
This handbook provides detailed documentation for every aspect of HomeSetup, including usage instructions, examples,
and explanations of various features and functionalities. It serves as a valuable resource to guide you through the
installation, configuration, and usage. Additionally, each function is equipped with a built-in help. By appending
`-h` or `--help` to the `__hhs_<function>` command, you can access specific help information for that particular
function or application. This allows you to quickly understand the purpose, usage, and available options of each
function without referring to external documentation.

To ensure a clear distinction and prevent conflicts with existing configurations, most of HomeSetup's aliases, commands,
and environment variables are prefixed with '__hhs_' or 'HHS_'. This consistent naming convention makes it easy to
identify HomeSetup-related components and prevents any unintended interference with your existing setup. You can rely
on these prefixes to locate and manage HomeSetup elements with confidence.

By referring to the User Handbook and utilizing the built-in function helps, you have access to comprehensive
documentation that empowers you to leverage the full potential of HomeSetup. Whether you're exploring new features or
customizing your setup, these resources provide the information you need to make the most of HomeSetup's capabilities.
